# AVA dataset download tools in Python

by William Veal Phan

Some scripts written in Python I used to download the [Google AVA dataset](https://research.google.com/ava/index.html).

Downloaded videos are hosted by the [Commong Visual Data Foundation](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/ava-dataset).

Not the cleanest of codde but I hope it might help sand save you some time :)
